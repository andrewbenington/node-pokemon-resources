# Pokémon Resources

TypeScript library for mapping between Pokémon game resources and their internal index numbers, generated from the text files maintained by the contributors to the [PKHeX Pokémon Save Editor](https://github.com/kwsch/PKHeX). This library exclusively relies on the research done by those PKHeX contibutors and https://progectpokemon.org.
